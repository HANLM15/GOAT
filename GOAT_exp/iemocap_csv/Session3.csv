Ses03F_script01_3_M028,i dont know where to start,sad
Ses03F_script01_3_F028,but chris it wouldnt work like this,sad
Ses03F_script01_3_M029,you know when i went overseas i said i was in command of a company,sad
Ses03F_script01_3_F029,yeah sure,sad
Ses03F_script01_3_M030,well i lost them,sad

Ses03F_script01_3_M031,just about all,sad
Ses03F_script01_3_F031,geez,sad
Ses03F_script01_3_M032,it takes a little while to toss that off because they werent just men,sad
Ses03F_script01_3_M033,for instance one time it had to have been raining several days there was this one kid he came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks put them in my pocket,sad
Ses03F_script01_3_M034,i mean thatsthats only a little thing but thats the kind of guys i had they didnt just die they killed themselves for each other and i mean that exactly a little more selfish and theyd still be here today,sad
Ses03F_script01_3_M035,and i and i thought something watching them go down,sad
Ses03F_script01_3_M036,everything was being destroyed see but there was one new thing that was being created a kind of responsibility man for man you understand me,sad
Ses03F_script01_3_M037,and to show thatto bring that onto the earth like some sort of monument standing right behind us where everyone could feel it and it would make a difference to him,sad
Ses03F_script01_3_M038,and i came back here and it was incredible there was no meaning in that here the whole thing to them was a bus accident,sad
Ses03F_script01_3_M039,and i went to work with dad and that rat race again and i felt what you saidashamed somehow because nobody was changed at all it seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys,sad
Ses03F_script01_3_M040,and i felt wrong to be alive to drive the car to see the new checkbook to see the new refrigerator i mean you can take those things out of the war but you got to know that when you drive that car that that came out of the love a man can have for another man and you got to be a little bit better because of that,sad
Ses03F_script01_3_M041,otherwise what you have here is loot and theres blood on it,sad
Ses03F_script01_3_M042,and i didnt want to take any of it,sad
Ses03F_script01_3_M043,and i guess that included you,sad
Ses03F_script01_3_F032,and you still feel that way,sad
Ses03F_script01_3_F033,because you cant feel that way never again chris you hear me never i mean the money and me too,sad

Ses03M_script01_3_M027,you remember overseas i was in command of a company,sad
Ses03M_script01_3_M028,well i lost them,sad
Ses03M_script01_3_F029,how many,sad
Ses03M_script01_3_M029,just about all,sad
Ses03M_script01_3_F030,geez,sad
Ses03M_script01_3_M030,takes a little while to toss that off cause they werent just men,sad
Ses03M_script01_3_M031,for instance one time thisit had been raining several days and this one kid he came up to me he gave me his last pair of dry socks put them in my pocket,sad
Ses03M_script01_3_M032,thats just a little thing but thats the kind of guys i had they didnt just die they killed themselves for each other and i mean that exactly,sad
Ses03M_script01_3_M033,a little more selfish and theyd still be here today and i got this idea watching them go down see everything was being destroyed but there was one new thing that was being created,sad
Ses03M_script01_3_M034,it was a kind of responsibility man for man you understand me,sad
Ses03M_script01_3_M035,and to show that and to bring that onto the earth again like some sort of monument standing right behind all of us and we could feel it and it would make a difference to him,sad
Ses03M_script01_3_M036,and then i came here and it was incredible there was no meaning in it here the whole thing to them was a kind of bus accident,sad
Ses03M_script01_3_M037,and i went to work with dad and that rat race again and i felt what you said ashamed somehow because nobody was changed at all,sad
Ses03M_script01_3_M038,it seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys i felt wrong to be alive i felt wrong to have that new checkbook,sad
Ses03M_script01_3_M039,open that new bank account drive the new car and see the new refrigerator,sad
Ses03M_script01_3_M040,cause you can take those things out of the war but you got to know when you drive that car that it came out of the love that a man can have for a man and you got to be a little bit better because of that,sad
Ses03M_script01_3_M041,otherwise what you have is loot and theres blood on it,sad
Ses03M_script01_3_M042,and i didnt want to take any of it and i guess that included you,sad
Ses03M_script01_3_F031,and you still feel that way,sad
Ses03M_script01_3_F033,that includes me too i mean and the money you have right to that money your father put planes up in the air good planes and he deserves it you should be proud of that a man should be paid for that,sad
Ses03M_script01_3_M045,annie im going to make a fortune for you,hap
