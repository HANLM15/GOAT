Ses05F_script01_3_F023,oh gee,sad
Ses05F_script01_3_M027,takes a little time to toss something like that off you know because they werent just men,sad
Ses05F_script01_3_M028,for instance theres this one time it had been raining for several days and this kid came up to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks you know he just put them in my pocket,sad
Ses05F_script01_3_M029,i know that thats not a big thing but its just the kind of guys i had they didnt die they they killed themselves for each other,sad
Ses05F_script01_3_M030,i mean that exactly thata little more selfish and they would have still been here today,sad
Ses05F_script01_3_M031,and i got an ideal watching them all go down everything was being destroyed see and,sad
Ses05F_script01_3_M032,but it seemed to me that something new was being created at the same time a kind of responsibility man for man do you understand me,sad
Ses05F_script01_3_M033,and to show thattoto bring that back onto the earth again like a like a monument and everyone would have it standing behind them and and it would make a difference for them,sad
Ses05F_script01_3_M034,and then i went home and it was incredible it had no meaning here,sad
Ses05F_script01_3_M035,it was all like some kind of bus accident to them i went back to work with my dad in that whole rat race again,sad
Ses05F_script01_3_M036,and i felt what you said ashamed somehowbecause nobody had changed at all it seemed to make suckers out of a whole lot of guys and,sad
Ses05F_script01_3_M037,it felt wrong to be aliveto open that bankbook to buy that new car to look at that new refrigerator i mean you can take those things out of the war but if you drive that car you have to know that that comes from the love that a man has for a man and youve got to be a little bit better than that,sad
